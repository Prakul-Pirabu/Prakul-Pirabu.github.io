        <p id="text">In the recent years, more hemophilia treatments which are more effective and less hassle have arrived, unveiling new possiblities for consumers. And as such, the question of how this evolving landscape impacts the treatment preferences for people with hemophilia arises.<br><br><br>The journal <a href="https://.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hae.14928" id="herelink">Haemophilia</a> sought to answer this quesstion in a new study called, "Patient and Caregiver Preferences for Haemophilia Treatments: A Discrete-Choice Exeriment." The study carried out a literature review and a survey open to all adult males with haemophilia age 18 years and older and caregivers of teenager/adult males with hemophilia age 17 years or younger.<br><br><br>A sample size of 151 affected adults and 151 caregiver respondents was generated by the surveys that were submitted online between February and April 2022. Respondents answered the questions based on six attributes: number of annual spontaneous bleeds; ability to live a more active lifestyle; how a medicine is prepared/administered; frequency of administration; risk of an inhibitor; risk of hospitalization due to treatment side-effects.<br><br><br>The burdens of teatment administration and storage were also explored through a best-worst scaling exercise. This BWS scaling system captures extremes including best and worst items, most and least important factors, biggest and smallest influences.<br><br><br>Both adult patients and caregivers preferred treatments that enabled a more active lifestyle and are associated with a lower inhibitor risk. Both groups valued an acitve life more than reducing spontaneous bleeds. This showed that the respondents were willing to make tradeoffs for potential improvements in lifestyle, as said by the authors of the study.<br><br><br>The authors posit that this study underscores the importance of a shared decision-making (SDM) approach to hemophilia care. Through SDM, healthcare providers and patients/caregivers may arrive at decisions that factor in the current treatment landscape and individual preferences.
