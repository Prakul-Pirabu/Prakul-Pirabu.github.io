        <p id="text">Haemophilia (also commonly called as "Hemophilia") is a bleeding disorder, usually inherited, in which the blood does not clot properly. In really rare cases, people may develop Haemophilia later in life. Blood contains many proteins called clotting factors that help to stop bleeding. People with Haemophilia usually have low levels of either factor 8 (VIII) or factor 9 (IX). This results in spontaneous bleeding after injuries occur. Those who have Haemophilia and undergo surgery, also are prone to bleeding during and after the opersation.<br><br><br>Haemophilia is caused by a mutation or change in one of the genes, the gene that is responsible for giving instructions for making the clotting proteins. The mutation can result in the clotting proteins not working properly, or to be missing altogether.<br><br><br>Haemophilia occurs in about 1 in every 5000 male births. There are two types of Haemophilia: "Haemophilia A" in which factor VIII (8) is missing, and "Haemophilia B" in which factor IX (9) is missing. Haemophilia A is about 4x more common than Haemophilia B, and it is estimated that over half have the severe form.<br><br><br>The most common and effective way of treating Haemophilia is through the introduction of artificial factors into the body. This is done through infusion (administering through veins) of commercially prepared factor concentrates. These infusions can stop bleeding episodes and, if administered on a regular basis (called prophylaxis), prevention of bleeding episodes is possible.<br><br><br>Learn more about Haemophilia at the CDC's <a id="herelink" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemophilia/facts.html">website</a>.</p>
