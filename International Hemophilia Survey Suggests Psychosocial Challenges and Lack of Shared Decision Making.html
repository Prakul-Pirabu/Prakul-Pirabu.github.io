        <p id="text">More than 2700 participants, representing four continents and 11 countries, completed the 'Hemophilia Life Stages and Changes Global Survey. The results released in a press release on 10 April 2023, with the actual survey conducted on February 27. The people surveyed were 950 adults with Haemophilia, 1080 caregivers and 679 healthcare professionals.<br><br><br>Some common themes that arose were communication challenges, including disclosure issues and the emotional impacts of the disease. 51% of patients reported that they hide their symptoms at least once a week. 68% avoid telling friends their condition due to the concern of being treated differently. 59% of patients reported that they feel anxiety about their condition, while 75% of haemotologists report that their patients undergo depression. Another theme that was expressed was disengagement between patients and their HCPs, as 83% signaled the desire to play a far more active role in their healthcare. The majority of patient respondents (84%) also expressed a wish for additional treatment options.<br><br><br>“The robust scope and multiple, diverse perspectives included in this research enable us to paint a detailed picture of what it's like to live with and manage this debilitating life-long condition throughout key aspects, milestones, and life events," said Kathy Steinberg, Vice President of Media and Communications Research at The Harris Poll. “And that picture of life with hemophilia reveals unique challenges, impacts, and unmet needs that point to how patient care and outcomes could be improved for this population.”<br><br><br>Read the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stagwells-stgw-the-harris-poll-unveils-first-of-its-kind-global-hemophilia-survey-on-the-daily-challenges-for-patients-caregivers-and-providers-301952157.html" id="herelink">original press release</a> to learn about the survey methodology and more detailed results.</p>
